AWS Account Chatbot - Example Output

Here are some examples of running the chatbot against a real AWS account. All of these are actual outputs from testing.


Example 1: Checking for public S3 buckets

Query: How many S3 buckets are exposed to the public?

The chatbot invoked the check_s3_public_access tool and found:

Total buckets: 1
Public: 0
Private: 1

Response: There is a total of 1 S3 bucket. None of the buckets are publicly accessible, all are private.


Example 2: Looking at what's in an S3 bucket

Query: What data does the S3 bucket aws-logs-779846804437-us-east-1 hold?

The chatbot listed the bucket contents:

Bucket: aws-logs-779846804437-us-east-1
Total files: 3056
Total size: 18.26 MB

  ... and 3046 more files

Response: The S3 bucket holds 3056 files totaling 18.26 MB. It contains ElasticMapReduce logs including container logs, Hadoop HDFS logs, and other application logs.


Example 3: Checking IAM user permissions

Query: What permissions does the user taytenb have?

The chatbot retrieved the user info:

User: taytenb
ARN: arn:aws:iam::779846804437:user/taytenb
Created: 2025-09-30

Managed Policies:
  - ReadOnlyAccess
  - IAMUserChangePassword

Response: User taytenb has ReadOnlyAccess (which provides read-only access to all AWS services) and IAMUserChangePassword (which allows changing their own password).


Example 4: Asking about public buckets in a different way

Query: Are any of my S3 buckets publicly accessible?

Response: No, none of your S3 buckets are publicly accessible. You have 1 S3 bucket and it is private.


Example 5: What happens when you ask about a bucket that doesn't exist

Query: What's in the bucket nonexistent-bucket-12345?

Response: The bucket 'nonexistent-bucket-12345' does not exist in your AWS account.


Example 6: What happens when you ask about a user that doesn't exist

Query: What permissions does user fake-user have?

Response: The IAM user 'fake-user' does not exist in your AWS account.


Notes

All these examples are from actual test runs. The chatbot typically responds in 3-5 seconds. It only does read-only operations so it can't accidentally change anything in your AWS account. You need to have AWS credentials configured and an OpenAI API key set up for it to work.
